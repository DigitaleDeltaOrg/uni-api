# Data management (non-bulk)

This module allows for adding, modifying or deleting data.
Notes:

- Observations are considered immutable. This means changing an observation is not permitted. If an observation is incorrect, it needs to be deleted and re-added.
- References can only be deleted when they are no longer used in any observation in the system.
