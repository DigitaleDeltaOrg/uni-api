# Reference

A reference is anything classifiable within the implementation that can occur in the following properties of an [observation](observation.md):

- foi (feature of interest)
- observedProperty (quantity)
- observingProcedure
- observer
- host
- parameter
- result/measure/uom (unit of measurement)
- result/vocab/vocabulary
- result/vocab/verb
- result/timeseries/TimeseriesMetadata/Status
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/Accuracy/measure/uom
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/Quality
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/Uom
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/InterpolationType
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/NilReason
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/CensoredReason
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/Qualifier
- result/timeseries/PointMetadata/Processing
  
This can be either a standard, or part of organisation-specific data **if** the [semantic definition](Definition/Semantic/v2023.01/semantic.json) does not provide the same of approximate definition.

The definition of reference in CSDL form can be found [here](Definition/csdl/v2023.01/csdl.xml).
